# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Amelia Dutta)

### Day 1: July 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Revise Tree, and Binary Tree concepts. Write a Java program to create a binary tree and traverse it in Pre-order.
- fixed the alignment using CSS and collaborated to update the e-commerce site.

### Day 2: July 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Write a Java program to traverse a binary tree in Level-order.
- Redesign developer portfolio.

### Day 3: July 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Write a Java program to traverse a binary tree using
     - Inorder Traversal
     - Postorder Traversal 
- Write a Python program to encrypt messages in the Ceaser Cipher method.

### Day 4: July 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Write a Java program to build a tree using level order
- Write a Java program to count the leaf nodes.
- Write a Java program to calculate the height of the tree.

### Day 5: July 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Write a Java program to calculate the diameter of a tree
     - Approach #1: By using recursion and the height of the tree      
- Contributed to a gaming repository by creating a guessing game using javascript.

### Day 6: July 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Write a Java program to calculate the diameter of a tree
     - Approach #2: By creating a Pair<Integer, Integer> class to store the height and diameter of each node simultaneously and return the maximum depth      
- [Implement a function that returns a string with N characters, the ith of which is the answer that should give for the question i in order to get it wrong.](https://www.metacareers.com/profile/coding_puzzles/?puzzle=1082217288848574)
- [Calculate the probability that the cell hit by your shot contains a battleship. The function should return this probability with an absolute or relative error of at most 10^-6](https://www.metacareers.com/profile/coding_puzzles/?puzzle=3641006936004915)

### Day 7: July 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Write a Java program to check whether the binary tree is balanced or not
     - Approach #1: By using recursion
